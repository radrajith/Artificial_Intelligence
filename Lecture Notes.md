### Intelligence Agents

**Agents** - an agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators. Its made up of Architecture(hardware of the agent) and Program(mind of the program)

**PEAS** - Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors
